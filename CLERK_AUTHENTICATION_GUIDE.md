# LoanSphere Clerk Authentication Integration Guide

## Overview
LoanSphere now uses Clerk authentication system instead of custom forms, providing enterprise-grade authentication for all user types including super admin.

## How Authentication Works Now

### 1. **Sign In/Sign Up Process**
- **Old System**: Custom forms in AuthModal component
- **New System**: Clerk's built-in authentication pages at `/sign-in` and `/sign-up`
- **Result**: Professional, secure authentication with 2FA support, SSO capabilities, and enhanced security

### 2. **User Types & Roles**
All five user types are supported through Clerk's role-based system:

| Role | Description | Dashboard Route | Features |
|------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Borrower** | Apply for loans | `/borrower-dashboard` | Loan applications, payment tracking |
| **Lender** | Offer loans | `/lender-dashboard` | AI underwriting, field agents, crypto investments |
| **Investor** | Fund opportunities | `/investor-dashboard` | Investment tracking, returns |
| **Distributor** | Partner platform | `/distributor-dashboard` | Distribution management |
| **Super Admin** | Platform oversight | `/admin/dashboard` | Full platform control, user management |

### 3. **Role Selection Flow**
1. User signs up through Clerk (`/sign-up`)
2. After authentication, redirected to Role Selector (`/role-selector`)
3. User selects their role from the comprehensive interface
4. Role stored in Clerk's user metadata
5. Automatic redirect to appropriate dashboard
